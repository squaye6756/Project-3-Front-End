This app uses a Mongo DB database and React in order to allow its users to
brag about their streetball team's skills and accomplishments. The app displays
all added teams in the database, and in each team, a user can update their
team's information: their players and skills, team name and location, and their
logo. Additionally, the teams can be assigned wins and losses and ranked
accordingly. Using React, all of this is done in an SPA, and with axios, the
app can connect with a database that updates and displays any new information
that enters the database.

Unsolved Problems:
-transition with showing the player skills can look a bit snappy if the text
is too long

Potential Future Updates:
-clicking on a player will reveal their stats (shooting %, turnovers, pass
completion)
-matchmaking (two teams can challenge each other)
-user identification (the goal of this site was to be a bit more lax, but it's
for the best that others not interfere with teams that they don't have anything
to do with)
-logo file input (rather than making a user transform whatever logo they may
have into an appropriate image link, they'd be able to upload their photos
directly from their device)
